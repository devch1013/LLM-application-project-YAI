{"url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02545v1", "title": "RAG Foundry: A Framework for Enhancing LLMs for Retrieval Augmented Generation", "abstract": "Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is inherently\ncomplex, requiring deep understanding of data, use cases, and intricate design\ndecisions. Additionally, evaluating these systems presents significant\nchallenges, necessitating assessment of both retrieval accuracy and generative\nquality through a multi-faceted approach. We introduce RAG Foundry, an\nopen-source framework for augmenting large language models for RAG use cases.\nRAG Foundry integrates data creation, training, inference and evaluation into a\nsingle workflow, facilitating the creation of data-augmented datasets for\ntraining and evaluating large language models in RAG settings. This integration\nenables rapid prototyping and experimentation with various RAG techniques,\nallowing users to easily generate datasets and train RAG models using internal\nor specialized knowledge sources. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness by\naugmenting and fine-tuning Llama-3 and Phi-3 models with diverse RAG\nconfigurations, showcasing consistent improvements across three\nknowledge-intensive datasets. Code is released as open-source in\nhttps://github.com/IntelLabs/RAGFoundry."}
